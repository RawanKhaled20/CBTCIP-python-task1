# CBTCIP-python-task1

This is a fun game where its rules that 2 players play against each other one will start and write a number, the other one should guess that number, if he guessed the number correctly from the first trial he will be called the master minds, else we will keep the round going on until he guess right
we will add a little hint that whenever he gets a digit correctly at the the specified spot we till him that he got that number correctly.
After he has guessed the numbers we will switch so that the one who wrote the number would have to guess and the other player would write the number he wishes. 
The same rules will apply for the first player but what makes a differnce is that if the first player got the correct guess in a less number of trials than player 2 he will be assigned masterminds. otherwise the second player will be assigned master minds.
